# FG8

This is a [Mango Blog](http://www.mangoblog.org) theme I've developed for use at [FusionGrokker.com](http://fusiongrokker.com).

I publish my themes as open source so that others can benefit from them, learning how best to develop their own themes using the Mango custom tag system. All of my themes are "pod-enabled," because pods are awesome.

This particular theme is built using Twitter Bootstrap, and is based on the [Superhero theme](http://bootswatch.com/superhero/) available at [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/).

## Compiling JS and CSS

I use [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/) to continuously recompile my LESS-CSS and JavaScript changes; but there's nothing preventing you from using a different build system. `assets/css/combined.css` is built from `assets/less/combined.less`, which itself simply imports other resources.
